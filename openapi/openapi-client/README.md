# Celeborn OpenAPI Client

To update the OpenAPI specification
- just update the specification under `openapi/openapi-client/src/main/openapi3/` and keep the schema definitions consistent between master and worker.
- Install JDK11+ by whatever mechanism is appropriate for your system, and set that version to be the default Java version (e.g., by setting env variable JAVA_HOME)
- run the following:
  ```sh
  build/mvn -pl openapi/openapi-client clean package -Popenapi-generate
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  build/sbt generate
  ```   
  This will regenerate the OpenAPI data models + APIs in the celeborn-openapi-client SDK.
